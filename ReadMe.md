PCA9685 motor driver:


First of all you need to know what is PCA9685 and how it works.
Then check for its wiring and how it's connected to Arduino.
To understand better you can check [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver?view=all).

## Wiring Hint
![Wiring](https://www.google.com/search?q=pca9685&sxsrf=APq-WBusbUae4dv_Q5lxBhu6kIkc8KQgEg:1643662550332&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-j8WT8Nz1AhUF57sIHbcuB_4Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw#imgrc=iFGtyNosYs6ceM)

Now you've learn a bit about PCA9685 it's time to try some thing more intereing.

Before run any code note its library is added to your Arduino IDE. The library is "Adafriut PWM Servo Driver"
if you need help check [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-all-about-arduino-libraries-install-use) out. 

Now run the code and see how it works.
